# BetterRest

Welcome to the **BetterRest** project from the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course by [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com). This project is a simple yet powerful app that calculates the best time to go to bed based on wake-up time, desired sleep duration, and coffee consumption.

---

## 🚀 About the Project

**BetterRest** is a user-friendly app designed to help users improve their sleep schedule by leveraging machine learning. By providing details like wake-up time, hours of sleep needed, and daily coffee intake, the app calculates the optimal bedtime using Apple’s CoreML framework.

## 🛠 Features

- **Bedtime Prediction:** Uses a CoreML model to calculate the best time to sleep.
- **User-Friendly Inputs:** Set your wake-up time, desired sleep hours, and coffee intake with easy-to-use controls.
- **SwiftUI Design:** A clean and intuitive user interface.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Demonstrates the use of CoreML in a real-world app.
